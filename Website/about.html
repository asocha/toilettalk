        <h1>What is Toilet Talk?</h1>
        <p>ToiletTalk’s goal is to help users find and travel to restrooms with ease. It is designed with the Android mobile OS as the primary platform, along with a website that will implement much of the same functionality, with a few changes. Those changes include greater functionality with the Google Maps interface. On both platforms, users will be able to search for restrooms by location and rating, as well as using GPS to find nearby restrooms. Users can then create reviews for these restrooms and rate them. We also include route planning, similar to Google Maps, except that we will also display all restrooms along the route, within a certain distance of the road. Users can save these routes to their profiles, as well as saving their favorite individual restrooms. Overall, we hope ToiletTalk will become a quick and easy to use application that anyone can use to find a restroom.</p>
